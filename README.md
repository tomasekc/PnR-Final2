# PnR-Final
The final project for my Programming and Robotics class
Hello future me. This is the project from back in Junior year at Gilmour. Its the final for the programming and robotics class.
You're either here to just look back at the projects you did, or you're here for an actual reason. Therefore, let me give you
a general description on this project and how it all works:
Firstly, there are several files:
    pigo.py is the file that is the parent guide.
    student.py is my final project.
    stop.py is just about stopping.
    And then, of course, is this README.md final.

But enough of the general stuff. I'll tell you what the actual definitions and fancy code stuff is all about.
    Firstly, all import methods are universal methods that are called. I don't have to write the methods all over for those methods
    The class is the whole class of the entire robot's code. All methods are under it.
        Those little things under it (such as MIDPOINT and STOP_DIST) are important tools. However, the numbers are unique to the robot I used for the project.
        Its helpful when calling those in different methods. Instead of constantly using a number that can change, I use a phrase that holds that number.
    __init__ method is simply for when the robot stops
    This then calls the handler method. The handler is the menu that shows up when the robot is running. From this menu you can select what number to choose.
        Each number calls a specific method as described in that menu.
    The next two methods are pretty easy to understand. It's just about turning.
